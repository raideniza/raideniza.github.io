Updated version of Henke's BaSim which gives healers more functionality. Defender and collector can both take aggro. Most of their movement and aggro mechanics are correct as far as I can tell. I don't know if healers have residual pathing on runners or not, and I don't have an implementation for healer reaggro in case of runner death.
